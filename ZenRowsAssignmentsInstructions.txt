ZenRows Technical Assessment 
(Fullstack Engineer)
 ZenRows is a web scraping API and service designed to help users extract data 
from websites efficiently and at scale.
 For this exercise, letʼs imagine youʼre joining our team to work on a new full-stack 
feature. Your goal is to deliver a maintainable MVP that demonstrates your 
problem-solving skills across both frontend and backend. Weʼre looking for 
thoughtful decisions, clean code, and a practical approach - donʼt worry about 
perfection, just focus on delivering a working, well-organized solution.
 Feature Context:
 We want to better understand our customersʼ needs for configured scraping jobs. 
To do this, weʼre giving them a way to select configuration pairs - matching a 
supported Origin (a website we can scrape, like Zillow or Redfin) with a supported 
Destination (where the scraped data will be sent, such as AWS S3 or PostgreSQL. 
Both lists of Origins and Destinations are pre-configured, and youʼll find sample 
data in the provided test-data.json file.

Requirements:
 Your app should display both lists to the customer, allowing them to select one 
Origin and one Destination to form a configuration pair. The UI should be natural 
and intuitive: users can select or unselect items with a click, but only one item 
from each list can be selected at a time. When both an Origin and a Destination 
are selected, the Save button becomes active. Clicking Save should store the 
selected pair and show a message like "You saved {origin} and {destination}." The 
saved pair must persist even after a page reload or navigation.
 For extra points, extend the feature to let customers save multiple different 
configuration pairs, not just one.
 Tech Recommendations:
 We suggest you use a dockerized Laravel app for the backend You can use for 
example a 
basic Laravel implementation) and Vue.js for the frontend (to stick to 
our current tech stack of the website), but youʼre welcome to explain your 
reasoning if you choose differently. Please apply the provided design style 

Also, you can use any external resource you need Google, StackOverflow,

ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.). Whatever you think will help you to solve the 
problem, use it!
 Focus on delivering a clear, maintainable MVP  avoid over-engineering, and keep 
your code organized, at the next steps we are going to extend the feature with 
more requirements, e.g. support of more origins, destinations, creating custom 
origins, destinations. If you run out of time, just leave comments explaining what 
youʼd do next. Include a Dockerfile so your app can be run easily, and briefly 
explain your technical decisions and how to run the application in comments or a 
short README. 
Enjoy the exercise, and good luck!
